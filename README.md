# WinMLDemo
Little sample app that shows how to use WinML in UWP to classify images.

This sample app will analyse pictures in the directory your running the app. It will determine if the pictures are from chocolat chip cookies or raisin cookies and will tag the images accordingly.

# Run it
Just run it once, then you can go to any folder using the command line, type 'TagPhotos' and the UWP console app will start up to analyse and tag all pictures in that folder.
